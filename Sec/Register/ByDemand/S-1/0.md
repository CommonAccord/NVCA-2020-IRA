FtNt.14.sec=As investors’ counsel, to prevent inadvertent perpetual roll-forward, consider inserting a date certain that reflects the agreed upon time frame.

FtNt.15.sec=The starting time period for initiating registration rights usually has these two components. The first time period is designed to allow the investors to force the Company to go public if it has not already done so (three (3) to five (5) years is common for this), although practically speaking this rarely, if ever, happens. The second time period is set around the expiration of any underwriter lock-ups after an IPO, which usually expire one hundred eighty (180) days after the IPO. See Section 2.11.
 	
FtNt.16.sec=As with all percentage vote thresholds, consideration will need to be given to whether any single investor can either control or block the vote. When dealing with multiple classes of preferred stock, it is important to understand the composition of the stockholder base to ensure that each series is getting the rights it bargained for. The Company will want this percentage to be high enough so that a significant portion of the investor base is behind the demand to cause the Company to effect a registered offering, particularly an IPO. Companies typically will resist allowing a single minority investor to cause a registration. Experienced investors will want to ensure that less experienced investors do not have the right to cause a demand registration. In some cases, holders of different series of preferred stock may request the right for that series to initiate a certain number of demand registrations. Companies typically will resist this due to the cost and diversion of management resources when multiple constituencies have this right.
 	
FtNt.17.sec=A trigger threshold may be negotiated and can range from twenty percent (20%) to one hundred percent (100%) of total Registrable Securities for demand registrations. However, some companies do not impose a threshold, relying instead on the minimum offering size.
  	
FtNt.18.sec=Note that the ability of a foreign investor (within the meaning of the regulations of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)) to trigger an IPO on demand may give rise to a CFIUS determination that that investor has “control” over the Company. The concept of “control” under the CFIUS regulations is very broad and subjective. It is defined as the power – direct or indirect and whether or not exercised – to “determine, direct, or decide important matters affecting” the Company. This same principle applies throughout the financing documents. Parties may therefore wish to confirm that no foreign investor will obtain this particular right; other rights that are likely to be of concern are indicated throughout this document, and in addition, highly conservative companies may wish to restrict foreign investors from obtaining any rights beyond the specific set of rights consistent with passivity outlined in the CFIUS regulations.
