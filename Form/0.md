Preliminary Note

An Investors’ Rights Agreement can cover many different subjects. The most common are information rights, registration rights, contractual “rights of first offer” or “preemptive” rights (i.e., the right to purchase securities in subsequent equity financings conducted by the Company), and various post-closing covenants of the Company.
